## About the project
Mutation rates influence gene stability, evolution, and genetic diversity. High mutation rates can lead to genetic disorders and reduced gene functionality. Understanding mutation patterns helps predict gene stability. Ethical considerations are integral to gene engineering, ensuring responsible use of technologies like CRISPR to balance innovation with potential societal and environmental impacts.
In this project, We conduct mutation rate analysis and evolutionary studies across multiple species to understand genetic variations. Using computational techniques, We analyse mutation patterns and train a predictive model that predicts the stability of mutated genes. If a gene is found to be unstable, We leverage CRISPR gene-editing technology to enhance its stability, ensuring genetic integrity.
This research bridges bioinformatics, machine learning, and gene engineering, offering insights into genetic evolution while pioneering a computational approach to gene stability.
## Problem Statement
- Excessive or unstable mutation rates can lead to genetic disorders, reduced gene efficiency, and evolutionary disadvantages. 

- Despite advancements in bioinformatics and genetic engineering, predicting gene stability and mitigating harmful mutations remains a challenge. 

- By addressing these challenges, this project seeks to provide insights into evolutionary genetics.

- To develop practical applications for medical advancements while considering ethical implications.
