# Mutation Rate Analysis and Gene Engineering
1. **Analyse Mutation Rates**: Study and quantify mutation rates in selected genes across nine species.
2. **Predict Gene Stability**: Develop models to assess the stability of these genes based on mutation patterns and environmental factors.
3. **Stabilize Genes Using Gene Engineering**: Propose and implement genetic modifications to enhance gene stability while preserving functionality.
4. **Compare :** Mutation Rate analysis across different species.
